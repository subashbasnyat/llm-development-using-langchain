Maybe I got unlucky with a defective mattress, but where's quality assurance for this company? That flat out should not happen. Emphasis on flat. Cause that's what the mattress was. Seriously horrible experience, ruined my friend's stay with me. Then they make you ship it back instead of just providing a refund, which is also super annoying to pack up an air mattress and take it to the UPS store.

       "\" Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804) was a founding father of the United States, who served as the first Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795. He was born on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean and was orphaned at a young age. Through his own intelligence and hard work, he was able to attend college in the United States and eventually became a key figure in the movement for American independence.\\n\\nHamilton was a strong proponent of a strong central government and played a key role in the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. He was also a leading advocate for the creation of a national bank and the development of a system of public credit. These policies helped to establish the financial stability of the new nation and set the stage for its future economic growth.\\n\\nIn addition to his role as a statesman, Hamilton was also a prominent lawyer and writer. He was a co-author of the Federalist Papers, a series of essays that helped to secure the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. He was also a prominent figure in the early years of the American political system, serving as a member of the Continental Congress and as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.\\n\\nDespite his many contributions to the early history of the United States, Hamilton's life was cut short when he was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important and influential figures in American history.\""
