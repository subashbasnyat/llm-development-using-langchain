       "\" Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804) was a founding father of the United States, who served as the first Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795. He was born on the island of Nevis in the British West Indies and was orphaned at a young age. Through hard work and determination, he was able to attend King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City.\\n\\nDuring the American Revolution, Hamilton served as an artillery captain in the Continental Army and became a close aide to General George Washington. After the war, he played a key role in the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and was one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, a series of essays arguing for the adoption of the Constitution.\\n\\nAs Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton implemented a number of policies that helped to establish the credit of the new nation, including the creation of a national bank and the assumption of state debts. He also advocated for a strong central government and a robust federal judiciary.\\n\\nHamilton's political views often brought him into conflict with other founding fathers, most notably Thomas Jefferson. Their disagreements over issues such as the role of the federal government and the nature of democracy helped to shape the early political landscape of the United States.\\n\\nHamilton was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804, at the age of 49. His legacy as a statesman, writer, and financial genius continues to be celebrated and debated by historians and scholars today.\""

    "1) Create embeddings: Generate embeddings for the documents using text embedding models. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text and enable efficient searching and similarity calculations.\n",
